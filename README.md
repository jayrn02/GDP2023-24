## Personal Group Design Project for Year 3 for IOT Rainwater

**lib** - Contains Library, ignore this file. Install Library directly in platformio and it will handle the rest  
**src** - Contains the functions for sensor and component as well as the main execution file  
**include** - Contains the header, there should be a 1 to 1 header for every cpp file  
**test** - Idk whats this  
**.gitignore** - Tells git to ignore whatever is in here to be pushed, just dont touch it unless you know what ya doing  
**the rest~~** - Just ignore them  


Dont forget to save your file, Visual Code does not update files in realtime and Git does not track unsaved file (Ctrl + S)
